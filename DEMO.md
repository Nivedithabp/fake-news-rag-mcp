docker-compose ps
```

### 2. Ingest the Dataset

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/ingest
2. Click "Ingest Dataset"
3. Wait for processing to complete (2-5 minutes)
4. Verify document count shows > 0

- Sources should primarily be "fake" labeled articles
- May mention sensationalism, emotional manipulation
- Could reference specific examples from the dataset

**Demo Points**:
- Show topic categorization capabilities
- Demonstrate pattern recognition
- Highlight the system's analytical power

### Scenario 4: Detection Methods

**Query**: "What methods can be used to detect fake news?"

**Expected Behavior**:
- Explains various detection techniques
- Sources should include both fake and real articles
- May mention fact-checking, source verification, critical thinking
- Could reference specific detection strategies

**Demo Points**:
- Show practical application knowledge
- Demonstrate educational value
- Highlight the system's comprehensive understanding

## ðŸŽ­ Interactive Demo Flow

### 1. Introduction (2 minutes)
- "This is a RAG system that can answer questions about news articles"
- "It uses AI to search through thousands of real and fake news articles"
- "Let me show you how it works with some example questions"

### 2. Basic Query (3 minutes)
- Ask: "What is fake news?"
- Show the answer with sources
- Click "Show Sources" to demonstrate provenance
- Explain how the system found relevant information

### 3. Comparative Analysis (3 minutes)
- Ask: "What's the difference between real and fake news?"
- Show how it uses both types of sources
- Highlight the citation system [1], [2], etc.
- Demonstrate the "Show Sources" feature

### 4. Advanced Query (3 minutes)
- Ask: "What topics are commonly covered in fake news?"
- Show the analytical capabilities
- Demonstrate how it processes multiple sources
- Highlight the educational value

### 5. Technical Demo (2 minutes)
- Go to /ingest page
- Show the admin interface
- Demonstrate status monitoring
- Explain the technical architecture

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Demo Issues

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"No sources found"**
   - Check if dataset was ingested properly
   - Verify vector database is running
   - Check MCP server logs

2. **Slow responses**
   - Normal for first queries (cold start)
   - Subsequent queries should be faster
   - Check if all services are running

3. **Connection errors**
   - Verify all Docker containers are running
   - Check port availability (3000, 4000, 8000)
   - Review environment variables

### Demo Preparation Checklist

- [ ] All services running (Chroma, MCP server, Frontend)
- [ ] Dataset ingested successfully
- [ ] API keys configured correctly
- [ ] Test queries work before demo
- [ ] Have backup questions ready
- [ ] Know the system limitations

## ðŸ“Š Demo Metrics to Highlight

- **Dataset Size**: "We're searching through X,XXX articles"
- **Response Time**: "Answers in under X seconds"
- **Source Diversity**: "Using both real and fake news sources"
- **Accuracy**: "AI-powered fact-checking with source citations"
- **Scalability**: "Can handle thousands of documents"

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Demo Messages

1. **"This isn't just a chatbot - it's a research assistant"**
2. **"Every answer comes with source citations you can verify"**
3. **"It learns from both real and fake news to provide balanced insights"**
4. **"The system is transparent - you can see exactly where information comes from"**
5. **"This could help journalists, researchers, and citizens fact-check information"**

## ðŸš€ Advanced Demo Features

### Show Technical Architecture
- MCP server API endpoints
- Vector database capabilities
- Embedding generation process
- Docker containerization

### Demonstrate Admin Features
